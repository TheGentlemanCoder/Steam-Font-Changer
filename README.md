# Steam-Font-Changer
A java application that lets you change the Steam Client font and font size easily

# How to use
1. Specify where Steam is installed by selecting the Steam folder in the first tab.

2. Choose the font, font size and overlay font size you want from the lists. 
(The listed fonts are those that are available in your system, so if you have installed a font, it will appear in the list (probably... at least it's supposed to).)

2. Click on the button "Confirm Selection".

3. SFC will create a new theme/skin for you (called SFC_Font), and will place it in the correct folder automatically. 

4. After that, restart Steam, and the new theme will be available for you to apply.
